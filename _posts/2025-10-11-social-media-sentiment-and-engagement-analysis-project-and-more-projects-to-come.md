title: Social Media Sentiment and Engagement Analysis Project and More Projects to Come!
---

## Social Media Engagement Analysis Project
I'm stoked to share another project on GitHub: [Social Media Sentiment & Engagement Analysis](https://github.com/hgbidon/Social-Media-Engagement-Analysis). This project builds an end-to-end data analysis pipeline in R to study engagement and sentiment across multiple social media platforms. It combines machine learning, text analytics, and data visualization to uncover patterns in how audiences interact with online content. I'm going to continue working on this project. Stay tuned to see the final results soon.

## More Projects to Come
I'm thinking of coding more personal projects with Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. I'm also thinking of learning PowerBI and Databricks, so I want to take certificiates at Coursera to get a structured course on these tools.

## Closing Words 
Thank you so much for sticking around. üòÅ
