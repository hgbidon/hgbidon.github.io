## New Coding Project in R: Global Music Sales Analysis: Trends, Genres & Regional Insights
I have amazing news! I'm so excited to showcase the GitHub repository of my newest project, [Global Music Sales Analysis: Trends, Genres & Regional Insights](https://github.com/hgbidon/Music-Sales-Analysis). I created Interactive visualizations and dashboards analyzing worldwide music sales trends across formats and years using R, Plotly, and R Shiny. I'm almost done with my new coding project in R and have posted the R code in GitHub. I just need to post the data visualizations and find out a way to post the R Shiny applications that I've created on GitHub.

It's been six years since I've coded anything in R, and I'm stoked that I've created an amazing data analysis project on global music sales. I've been wanting to work with a data set regarding music, so I'm joyful that I finally had the chance to achieve that goal. 

Please be patient while I upload my visualizations on the [Global Music Sales Analysis: Trends, Genres & Regional Insights repository](https://github.com/hgbidon/Music-Sales-Analysis). Thank you so much!

## Progress of the NLP Diary Analysis for Language Learning
I decided to add even more diary entries for my <strong>NLP Diary Analysis for Language Learning Project</strong> since I want to showcase how my writing evolves in my weaker languages, <strong>Spanish</strong> and <strong>Norwegian</strong>. Ever since I've gotten into chess in September 2025, I've been writing about it mainly in Spanish. I can't wait to see how the sentiment analysis and topic modeling evolves in this project. I can't wait to show all of you my language learning progress when I've made more progress in this project. 

As, I stated before, I will also implement more advanced NLP techniques to analyze all of the diary entries that I've written thus far. Additionally, I decided to in French, German, Spanish, and Norwegian from January 2024 to January 2025. Stay tuned to see the [updated repository of this project](https://github.com/hgbidon/NLP-Diary-Analysis-for-Language-Learning) to see the progress that I've made so far.

## Upcoming Projects
I'm planning on creating more personal projects using Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. Stay tuned to find out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hgbidon/) and [my website](https://hgbidon.github.io). 

## Closing Words 
Thank you so much for those who are reading my posts on my GitHub website. I truly appreciate it. ðŸ˜„
