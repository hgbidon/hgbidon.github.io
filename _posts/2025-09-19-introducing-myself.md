  Hello everyone! I'm glad to introduce myself on my personal website.
</div>

## Introducing Myself

I'm Hana Gabrielle, an <strong>an aspiring Data Scientst</strong> who is also <strong>a coding enthusiast</strong>, <strong>an avid language learner</strong>, <strong>bird watcher</strong>, <strong>solo traveler</strong>, <strong>runner</strong> 🏃, <strong>rock climber</strong>, <strong>reader</strong> 📙, and <strong>blogger</strong>. Currently, I know <strong>French</strong> 🇫🇷 (B2/C1), <strong>German</strong> 🇩🇪 (B1/B2), <strong>Spanish</strong> 🇪🇸 (B1), and <strong>Norwegian</strong> 🇳🇴 (A2/B1) to varying degrees. 

In addition, I love coding for fun in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>, specifically <strong>MySQL</strong>. Since June 2025, I'm learning more about <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> by coding a project analyzing my journal entries in <strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, and <strong>Norwegian</strong> from January 2024 to September 2025. Additionally, I completed a project where I've conducted A/B testing on marketing campagins based on [this Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing). I'm going to post it later this afternoon on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hgbidon). 

As for my other coding projects, I plan on creating more personal projects using Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. 

Stay tuned to find out more! Talk to you soon.
