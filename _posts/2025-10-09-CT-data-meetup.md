## CT Data Meetup in Downtown New Haven

It's been a few weeks since I last blogged on my new GitHub website. So far, everything has been going extremely nicely. This past Saturday, I've met up with two
amazing people, Mitchell and Azhar, where we discussed about AI, machine learning, data science, and our lives. I even learned more about [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), 
which is a tool that I've heard about, but never used in my research or full-time jobs. It was amazing seeing a live demo from Azhar. Learn more about the (CT Data Professional Meetup)[https://www.meetup.com/ct-data-professionals-meetup-group/] in New Haven, CT, in [Azhar's LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7380956489253027840/). 

Stay tuned to find out more about my adventures with data, AI, and everything about tech from my perspective on [my GitHub website](https://hgbidon.github.io). If
you are also interested about my personal blog, [Insightful Bytes](https://hanagabrielle.com), please feel free to read my blog! I am sporadic on my posting due to
job hunting, so please hold on to your horses.

Thank you everyone!
