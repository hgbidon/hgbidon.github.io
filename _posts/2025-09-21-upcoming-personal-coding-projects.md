## Progress of the NLP Diary Analysis for Language Learning
I'm almost done with this project and will focus on applying more advanced NLP techniques to analyze all of the diary entries that I've written in <strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, and <strong>Norwegian</strong> from <em>January 2024</em> to <em>September 2025</em>. Stay tuned to see the [updated repository of this project](https://github.com/hgbidon/NLP-Diary-Analysis-for-Language-Learning).

## Marketing Campaigns Analysis Project
By the way, I've created a [repository of the Marketing Campaigns Analysis Project](https://github.com/hgbidon/Marketing-Campaigns-Analysis). I've conducted A/B testing in Jupyter Notebook to see how different testing groups, Ads vs PSAs, affect the conversion rates. I've used [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing).

## Upcoming Projects
I'm planning on creating more personal projects using Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. Stay tuned to find out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hgbidon/).
