## Progress of the NLP Diary Analysis for Language Learning
I'm almost done with this project and will focus on applying more advanced NLP techniques to analyze all of the diary entries that I've written in <strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, and <strong>Norwegian</strong> from <em>January 2024</em> to <em>September 2025</em>. Stay tuned to see the [updated repository of this project](https://github.com/hgbidon/NLP-Diary-Analysis-for-Language-Learning).

## Upcoming Projects
I'm planning on creating more personal projects using Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. Stay tuned to find out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hgbidon/).
